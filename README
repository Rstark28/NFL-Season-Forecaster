## Usage

1. Run the simulation:
   ```sh
   python main.py

### Query Loop Commands

Within the simulation, you can use various commands in the query loop to interact with the system:

- `update`: Manually update a game.
- `simulate_season`: Simulate an entire NFL season n times.
- `exit`: Exit the simulation.

### Simulation Mechanics

The simulation operates using Elo ratings to determine the outcome of games. Each team is assigned an Elo rating, which is adjusted based on the results of simulated games. The Elo rating system helps to predict the probability of a team's victory and updates ratings to reflect the performance of teams over time.
